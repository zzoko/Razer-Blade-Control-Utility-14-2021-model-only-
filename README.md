Razer-Blade-Control-Utility by razer-ctl / tdakhran that i have modified the code for so that it can work on razer blade 14" 2021 model. All credit to them for the original code, see github links to their page.

Since the original app was made for 2023 models i also had to remove a few features, but all the basic stuff that synapse offers like custom performance mode, selectable fan speed on balanced profile and even a custom silent mode that isnt normally available is here.

PS: Dont run it at the same time as synapse, they might fight for control, changing performance mode while ingame may cause crash. The code was a bit unstable so the app may also close on its own, but all settings should persist unless you change them with razer synapse again.
